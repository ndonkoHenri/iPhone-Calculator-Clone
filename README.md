# iPhone-Calculator-Clone

### What is this?
A Mimic/Clone of the Calculator App found on all iPhones. 

### How or where to start?

The program is quite simple and straight-forward!
Just:
- clone this repo and unzip it
- move into the file
```bash 
     cd iPhone-Calculator-Clone
 ```
- run the `icalculator.py` file 
```bash 
     python icalculator.py
 ```
- and... that's it! Hurray!

Start using it and compare with what happens on an iPhone. 

You could also suggest more things I could add to make this better.
